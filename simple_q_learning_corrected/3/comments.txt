## Resulting Behaviour

model moves towards coins but does not pick them up efficiently
kills itself from time to time but more often than not realizes it is supposed to avoid this

-> next training based on this iteration of the model
-> extend feature space to coin on next field
-> extend danger-feature to 'steps to safety' <- not used in next training
-> implement punishment for going into danger <- not used in next training
