## Resulting Behaviour

model moves towards coins but does not pick them up efficiently
kills itself regularly

-> next training based on this iteration of the model
-> play more training games with current state of model but lay focus again
on exploration, because if the new feature and higher punishment on bombs
-> extend danger-feature to 'steps to safety' <- not used in next training
-> implement punishment for going into danger <- not used in next training
