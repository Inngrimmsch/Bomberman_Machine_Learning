## Resulting Behaviour

model moves towards coins but does not pick them up efficiently
kills itself rarely
waits a lot

-> train next iteration based on this one
-> punish waiting to make him choose a move
-> take away the coin-motion-part in act()
-> make random prob and alpha small for next step
