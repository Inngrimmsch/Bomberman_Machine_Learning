## Resulting Behaviour

model seems to 'search' for coins but is not always able to actually find them
kills itself from time to time but more often than not realizes it is supposed to avoid this
model spends many moves 'waiting'

-> increase punishment for placing bomb
-> increase punishment for waiting
-> increase reward for coin searching
