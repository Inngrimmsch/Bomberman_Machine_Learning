## Resulting Behaviour

model moves towards coins but does not pick them up efficiently
if coins are next to it it takes them in quick succession
kills itself regularly

inefficiency grew and suicide issue as well

-> lay focus on danger avoidance since this issue seems to grow
-> train from "ground up" with new coin feature since last model already had an issue with
bombs and with 0-q entries
