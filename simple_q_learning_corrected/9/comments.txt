## Resulting Behaviour

model moves towards coins but does not pick them up efficiently
if it is right next to coins it takes them all in quick succession
model kills itself regularly

-> lay focus on danger avoidance since this issue seems to grow
-> train from "ground up" with new coin feature since last model already had an issue with
bombs and with 0-q entries
